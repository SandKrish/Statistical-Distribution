# Statistical-Distribution

This notebook explains normal distribution, Skewness and Kurtosis plot.

Normal Distribution.
Normal distribution can be ploted using numpy.linspace and it is symmetric and bell-shaped and cluster around mean.

Skewness measures: the extend to which the data values are not symmertical

Kurtosis : measures the peakness of the distribution, how sharply curve rises approaching the center of the distribution.
